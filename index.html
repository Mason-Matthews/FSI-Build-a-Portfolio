       <h3>About Me...</h3>
          <p>
              Whenever I get a package of plain M&Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness
              of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and
              forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters.
              That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.
              I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are 
              genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the 
              intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will
              get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably 
              this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way,
              the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M,
              the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope 
              and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, 
              “Please use this M&M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2
              pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.
              From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion.
              <strong><br>There can be only one.</strong>

    <!-- 
      Directions:
        *1. Create a DIV element to contain the page content
        *2. Inside your DIV, create an H1 tag that contains your name as the text
        *3. Below your H1 tag, create an H2 tag that contains the content text "Software Developer"
        *4. Below your H2 tag, create an HR tag which will make a horizontal line
        *5. Create a paragraph tag and put a sentence of your choice in it. (Suggestion: "My favorite thing about programming is _______")
        *6. Make the word "favorite" italicized
        *7. Make an image tag with the src attribute linked to a picture of yourself or of a placeholder image. Make sure you make an alt attribute too!
        *8. Create an H3 tag that says "About Me"
        *9. Create a paragraph tag that contains the "lorem ipsum" text. You will need to do a search for this text - it is long!
        *10. Create an H3 tag that says "My Projects"
        *11. Create an unordered list with 3 list items that say "Project 1", "Project 2", and "Project 3"
        *12. Add another H3 that contains "Contact Me" as text
        *13. Create a paragraph that contains a fake phone number, e.g., "Phone: (202) 555-1234"
        *14. Create a link tag (<a>) with a direction to mail to a fake email address. This is done by making a regular link, but in the href attribute, put mailto:fake@email.com (this opens up your email program with the TO field already filled out-try it!)

        BONUS: Try one of the following ideas if you finish early
          - Switch out your lorem ipsum for Hipster Ipsum (https://hipsum.co/)
          - In your contact me section, make the text "Phone:" and "Email:" bolded
